  <h1>Rearview</h1>
    <p class="reverse-text">
I don't have demons<br/>
I only have lovers and exes<br/>
I only have conversations that aren't ripe yet.<br/>
<br/>
When we stood breaking up,<br/>
We bit into the tenderness of the first peach of the season<br/>
Learning about fruiting bodies becoming life long practice<br/>
Letting go becoming the pen-ultimate gesture of love<br/>
<br/>
When I sat at the wheel, gazing out the rear view<br/>
I thought that because I could only see things there --<br/>
that I had missed them before<br/>
But that's not how our bodies fruit.<br/>
<br/>
When we said all break ups are a good thing<br/>
What we meant is that our labor was only edible right as it left the vine<br/>
That to consume the end, was to eat the fruit<br/>
<br/>
Distance yields to anger yields to sadness yields to softness.<br/>
I want to soften next to you, don't want to demonize you.<br/>
This isn't a poem, it's a truce.
