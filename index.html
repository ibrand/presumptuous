Presumptuous
        </h1>
        <p class="pre-wrap">
We stand breaking up,
I tell you I felt like I was strangling you and you call me
Presumptuous.
That word digs like a knife. So many consonants. So sharp.
Don't pressume
Cause it'll press u and me
Like the lemon that I'd decided to turn to lemonade.
Like the pressure we felt for 6 months that pushed the tears out of your eyes
Like the fingers that I thought had been around your neck but had really been around mine.
Cause listen
Presumptuous might be sharp.
I wish I'd listened instead.
Listen.
Such a soft word. The lenient lenition of consonants choosing to soften next to each other.

I wish I'd listened to my body when it told me what to do.
</a>

Cause we stood breaking up,
You told me that now I could fulfill all of my dreams without you getting in the way and I should have called you
Presumptuous.
Let those consonants push in on you too.
Don't pressume
Cause it'll press u and me
Into a corner where there's no space to breathe
Into a corner where your time is a scarcity
Into the corner that's so unforgivingly dirty that it can't be cleaned
And listen.
Presumptuous might be sharp.
I wish I'd listened instead.
Listen.
I want to be soft with you. I want to chose to soften next to one another.
I did my best to listen to you, did you do your best to listen to me too?
