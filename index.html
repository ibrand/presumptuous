So many consonants. So sharp.<br> Don't pressume<br> Cause it'll press u and me<br> Like the lemon that I'd decided to turn to lemonade.<br> Like the pressure we felt for 6 months that pushed the tears out of your eyes<br> Like the fingers that I thought had been around your neck but had really been around mine.<br> Cause listen<br> Presumptuous might be sharp.<br> I wish I'd listened instead.<br> Listen.<br> Such a soft word. The lenient lenition of consonants choosing to soften next to each other.<br> <a class="body-link" href="https://ibrand.github.io/presumptuous/body.html"> I wish I'd listened to my body when it told me what to do.<br><br> </a> Cause we stood breaking up,<br> You told me that now I could fulfill all of my dreams without you getting in the way and I should have called you<br> Presumptuous.<br> Let those consonants push in on you too.<br> Don't pressume<br> <a class="press-link" href="https://ibrand.github.io/presumptuous/press/index.html">Cause it'll press u and me</a><br> Into a corner where there's no space to breathe<br> Into a corner where your time is a scarcity<br> Into a corner that's so unspeakably dirty that it can't be cleaned<br> And listen.<br> Presumptuous might be sharp.<br> I wish I'd listened instead.<br> Listen.<br> I want to be soft with you. I want to choose to soften next to one another.<br> I wish I'd listened to myself when I knew what to do.<br> </p> </body></html>
